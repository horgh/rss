This package provides basic support for RSS/RDF/Atom feeds. Specifically it
provides functions for parsing XML as one of these formats, and for writing out
feeds as RSS 2.0.

I use it in an RSS reader, [gorse](https://github.com/horgh/gorse).

It is pretty basic and not overly strict. My use case is to get the minimum
amount of information about items in feeds, such as titles, URLs, and
descriptions.
